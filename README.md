# Acceptance-angle-of-optical-fiber-in-water
Acceptance angle is the maximum incidence angle of a light ray which can be used for injecting light into a fiber core or waveguide
The acceptance angle of an optical fiber is defined based on a purely geometrical consideration (ray optics): it is the maximum angle of a ray (against the fiber axis) hitting the 
fiber core which allows the incident light to be guided by the core. The sine of that acceptable angle (assuming an incident ray in air or vacuum) is called the numerical 
aperture, and it is essentially determined by the refractive index contrast between core and cladding of the fiber.
